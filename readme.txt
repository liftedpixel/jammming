Jammming - a Codecademy project

it searches the Spotify API and lets you make a playlist that you can save to your Spotify account

current issues
spotify.js - getaccesstoken() is really wonky and kinda double fires (might be fixed??)
tracklist.js - i can console.log(TrackList.props.tracks) but i can't TrackList.props.tracks.map()??

additional features to write about
-name playlist 'Name's Playlist' based off name grabbed from api
