Jammming - a Codecademy project
jammmmmmmmmmmming.surge.sh (12)

it searches the Spotify API and lets you make a playlist that you can save to your Spotify account

current issues
spotify.js - after first search page resets and starts over, losing that first search
app.js/playlist.js - playlist name not changing to default after saving playlist

deployment to surge isn't working but i think i know why stay tuned

additional features to write about
-name playlist 'Name's Playlist' based off name grabbed from api
