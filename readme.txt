Jammming - a Codecademy project

it searches the Spotify API and lets you make a playlist that you can save to your Spotify account

current issues
app.js - not passing tracksArray to tracklist.js
spotify.js - getaccesstoken() is really wonky and kinda double fires
tracklist.js - not getting the tracksArray from app.js

additional features to write about
-show log in before searching instead of search bar if not logged in
-name playlist 'Name's Playlist' based off name grabbed from api
