it searches the SPOTIFY API and lets you make a PLAYLIST that you can save to your ACCOUNT now with an easy to remember URL

NOTE: My API keys are not included. This app is currently looking for the file 'src/components/Spotify/secret.js' with the exported variables clientId and clientSecret. Please provide your own, or check out the link above for a working demo.


current issues
index.css? - some bars have shown up above and below the header
spotify.js - page resets after the first search
app.js/playlist.js - playlist name not changing to default after saving playlist
searchbar.js - search bar doesn't clear when it should, doesn't search when hitting enter

additional features to add
