Jammming - a Codecademy project
jammmmmmmmmmmming.surge.sh (12)

it searches the SPOTIFY API and lets you make a PLAYLIST that you can save to your ACCOUNT now with an easy to remember URL

current issues
index.css? - some bars have shown up above and below the header
spotify.js - sometimes page resets after search, losing that search. would probably lose playlist if one was made, but it only happens here
app.js/playlist.js - playlist name not changing to default after saving playlist
searchbar.js - search bar doesn't clear when it should

additional features to add
-log in button before first search
-name playlist 'Name's Playlist' based off name grabbed from api
-more pages of tracks
