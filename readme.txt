it searches the SPOTIFY API and lets you make a PLAYLIST that you can save to your ACCOUNT now with an easy to remember URL

current issues

spotify.js - after first search page resets and starts over, losing that first search sometimes
app.js/playlist.js - playlist name not changing to default after saving playlist
searchbar.js - search bar doesn't clear when it should

additional features to add
