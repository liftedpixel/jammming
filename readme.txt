Jammming - a codecademy project

it searches the spotify api and lets you make a playlist that you can save to your spotify account

current issues
app.js - search() not receiving anything from Spotify.search even though I can log out the retrieved info
playlist.js - idk
searchbar.js - idk
searchresults.js - idk
spotify.js - getaccesstoken() is really wonky and kinda double fires, flashes a quick error on search, only able to log track data, won't pass to app.js for some reason
track.js - idk
tracklist.js - currently being passed an empty array, crashes trying to find tracks to make

additional features to write about
-show log in before searching instead of search bar if not logged in
-name playlist 'Name's Playlist' based off name grabbed from api
